    "\n",
    "![](unithydrograph3.png)\n",

    "Unit hydrograph models contain a few common themes, first input hyetograph, then a loss model which are combined to produce the excess precipitation signal\n",

    "- Direct runoff duration (time) is same for all uniform-intensity storms of same duration (time)\n",

    "- Thus a D-hour unit hydrograph is a response to a D-hour “pulse” of excess precipitation.\n",

    "($T_D$ in the diagram)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each watershed has a characteristic response time, $T_{lag}$ and $T_P$ in the diagram.\n",
    "The characteristic time of the watershed is related to physical characteristics of the watershed contributing area, slope, etc.\n",
    "The time step size for aggregation must the same as the duration, and the time-to-peak for the watershed must be an integer multiple of that value.\n",

Extension for parametric hydrographs is fairly easy, just extend the matrix as needed.  For classically obtained weights, the S-curve technique as as good as any.  Fortunately most software has parametric UH choices built-in, so this is a non-issue these days unless you are using historical UHs and need to bring them into the 21st century.\n",

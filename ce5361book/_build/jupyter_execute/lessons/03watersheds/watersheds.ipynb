    "Watershed delineation is a fundamental process in hydrology and environmental science that involves defining the boundaries of a drainage area or catchment. It identifies the geographic area from which all precipitation and surface runoff flow into a single outlet, typically a river, stream, or lake. \n",
    "\n",
    "This analytical method is typically employed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. By-hand using paper or digital maps (see example below)\n",
    "2. Semi-automated using digital maps (see example below)\n",
    "3. Fully-automated using digital elevation data and geographic information systems (GIS) \n",
    "\n",
    "In all three cases above the goal is to trace the flow of water and determine the contributing area to a specific point of interest. Watershed delineation plays a crucial role in various applications, including flood management, water resource planning, and environmental conservation, by providing a spatial framework to understand and manage water-related processes within a defined geographic region."

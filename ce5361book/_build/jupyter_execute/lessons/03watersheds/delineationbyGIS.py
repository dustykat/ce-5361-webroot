# # Delineation (using GIS)
# 
# Here we use QGIS as the tool to delineate a watershed.

# The example follows the YouTube video [Watershed Delineation in QGIS (Quickest & Easiest Tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fvy9xtAHc4).  If you find this too difficult you may wish to consider a career in [Cosmetology](https://www.boardofcosmetology.net/).

# 
# The fundamental workflow is:
# 1. Download DEM file (from National Elevation Dataset or something similar).  Then open the file (as RASTER).
# 2. Select or accept the CRS (Coordinate reference system)
# 3. Designate area of interest.
# 4. Pit filling algorithm.
# 5. Identify pour point(s).
# 6. Delineate using flow-acculumation algorithms.
# 
# ## Where to get data?
# For basemaps, OSM (Open Street Maps) is probably sufficient for most uses.
# 
# For DEMs:
# 1. SRTM (NASA server) has 30-meter resolution, world-wide.  Higher resolution for some areas. 
# 2. Higher resolution (1-meter) from [USGS](https://apps.nationalmap.gov/downloader/)
# 3.

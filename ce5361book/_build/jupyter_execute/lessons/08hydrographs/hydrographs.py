# # 8. Hydrographs
# 
# A hydrograph is a plot (or paired time-discharge values) of discharge versus time for a location (on a stream).
# 
# ![](hydrograph-1.png)
# 
# An idealized hydrograph has
# - Rise portion
# - Peak portion
# - Recession portion
# - Inflection point
# The hydrograph pictured also has a baseflow component
# - Flow in absence of a storm

# ## Direct Runoff Hydrograph

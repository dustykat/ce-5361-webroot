# # 12. Rainfall-Runoff Modeling
# 
# A rainfall-runoff model is a mathematical model describing the rainfallâ€“runoff relations of a rainfall catchment area, drainage basin or watershed. It produces a runoff hydrograph in response to rainfall inputs, represented by a hyetograph. In other words, the model calculates the conversion of rainfall into runoff.
# 
# In comparatively sophisticated modeling one considers the rainfall signal coming into the watershed, filtered by losses from evapotranspiration, infiltration, any water that is added to storage - what remains is the runoff. 
# 
# We will examine the losses in subsequent sections, here they will be presented as needed without much explaination.

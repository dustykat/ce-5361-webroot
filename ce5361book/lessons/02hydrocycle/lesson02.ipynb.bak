    "# Hydrologic Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "The water, or hydrologic, cycle describes the journey of water as water molecules make their way from the Earth’s surface to the atmosphere and back again, in some cases to below the surface. This gigantic system, powered by energy from the Sun, is a continuous exchange of moisture between the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land.\n",
    "A typical diagram depicting the hydrologic cycle is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](hydrologic_cycle.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The driving force for the cycle is solar energy that provides the energy to vaporize liquid water that then rises into clouds, moves onshore, and rains (or snow, sleet, $\\dots$.  and other forms of <strong>precipitation</strong>)\n",
    "A portion of the rain becomes runoff, another portion returns to the atmosphere as evaporation, another portion infiltrates into the ground and becomes groundwater.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more detailed accounting of the precipitation is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A portion known as interception is retained on buildings, vegetation, and other surfaces that eventually evaporates - the remaining quantity is called **effective precipitation**\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "Excess precipitation is a similar concept.  When discussing rainfall-runoff processes using some model (i.e. unit hydrograph methods), the quantity that becomes runoff is called excess precipitation.  The terms are frequently used interchangeably.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Some of the effective precipitation also evaporates directly.\n",
    "3. Another portion of effective precipitation **infiltrates** into the ground - a portion of infiltrated water returns to the atmosphere via transpiration, the remainder either percolates deeper into the ground or is incorporated in the vegetative biomass.\n",
    "4. The water that percolates deeper into the ground becomes **recharge** to the groundwater system, and may appear at some point as **baseflow** in streams.\n",
    "5. If the precipitation exceeds the combined evaporation and infiltration puddles form in small depressions on the land surface - this is called depression storage.\n",
    "6. After the depressions are filled they join and a continuous film of water can begin to flow over the surface to a stream channel.  This portion that can flow is called the **excess precipitation** (see the note above), and the flow is called the **direct runoff**.\n",
    "7. Runoff occurs when the film of water begins to move - water in this film is said to be in **detention storage**, and evaporation occurs from this compartment too. When precipitation ceases, the water in detention storage eventually joins the stream channel.\n",
    "8. The destination of all streams is open bodies of water such as lakes, seas, and oceans which are subject to substantial evaporation.\n",
    "9. The evaporation and tanspiration from all these sources combine and carry moisture back into the atmosphere which condenses and repeats the cycle.\n"

    "## Water Budget Definition\n",
    "The water budget, or <strong>hydrologic balance</strong> is simply the expression of the conservation of mass in hydrologic terms for a hydrologic system.  \n",
    "Generally it is expressed as a rate (or volume) balance.\n",
    "The hydrologic equation is the fundamental tool in hydrology to describe amounts of water in storage in different compartments at different scales.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The equation expressed in “words” is\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate of inflow - Rate of outflow =  Rate of change of storage + Rate of internal mass generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Symbolically it is exrepssed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dI}{dt} - \\frac{dO}{dt} = \\frac{dS}{dt} + \\frac{dG}{dt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "$I$ is inflow volume, $O$ is outflow volume, $S$ is storage volume (i.e. within a watershed), and $G$ is generated volume.\n",
    "$G$ is generally zero, but is included to be consistent with the balance equations you have learned elsewhere (i.e. environmental engineering, chemistry, $\\dots$)"

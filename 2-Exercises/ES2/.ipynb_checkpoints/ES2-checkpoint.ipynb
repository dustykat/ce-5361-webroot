    "Completion, plausible solution, documentation of methods employed.\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "This exercise is largely a reading exercise, you will probably benefit from note taking during the readings - the \"analysis\" portion at the end is for you to self-asses your understanding and synthesis of the readings.  You will apply what you read to construct a transfer function (excess P into Q) in Problem 2 then apply your function to a new storm (Problem 3).\n",

The memorandum is to summarize key points, identify common themes or trends across the readings, compare and contrast different methodologies, and offer conclusions based on the collective information. This document serves to distill complex information into a coherent and informative summary, highlighting the essential aspects of the analytical methods covered in the readings.  Keep in mind your summarized content is to be applied to the next problem."
